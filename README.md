# Selenium_Java


## Technology  
* **Eclipse (Environment)**
* **Java (Language)**
* **Selenium (Framework)**


## Issues I ran into
I downloaded an incompatiable version of the Chrome driver for my browser. Make sure you get the right one or else the browser will load and then automatically close without running the code and returns an error saying it is because of incompatiable versions. 

## Purpose
This code takes you my website. It's just a refresher for me on Selenium so it does something really simple.
